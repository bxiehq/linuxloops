# LinuxLoops

<!-- Special Thanks -->

## Special Thanks

First of all, thanks goes to:
- The lxc/lxd project for maintaining Linux container rootfs archives.
- The [Linux-Surface crew][linux-surface] for greatly improving Linux support on Surface devices.
- MrChromebox for its awesome Chromebooks custom firmwares.
- The Chromebrew framework which allows encryption support for brunch / chromeos.

<!-- About This Project -->
## About This Project

The purpose of the LinuxLoops is to allow the installation of linux x86_64 distros within disk images. The LinuxLoops bash script will create a disk image containing a 16MB EFI partition, a 1GB boot partition, the main rootfs partition and an optional partition for swap. Distros will be installed in the image and an initramfs hook will allow booting the disk image through a specific grub config.

The minimum size for a LinuxLoops image has been defined as 10GB (with at least 8GB for the main rootfs) as it should allow most distros to install without issue. However, if you intend to install gentoo you will most likely need 40 GB minimum for the main rootfs (as it needs a lot of disk space to build everything from source).

Some use cases for LinuxLoops:
- To keep Windows or ChromeOS as the main OS on the computer and intall Linux without modifying the partition table.
- To use separate linux environments for different purposes (work, gaming...) without having to deal with complex partition tables.
- To easily setup Linux distros with fully encrypted rootfs and swap (the EFI and boot partitions are not encrypted).
- To have a full Linux environment which can also be used as a VM from another OS.
- For easy backup management, backing up a distro is as simple as copying a file.
- You tell me...

**Warning: Keep in mind that even though they are stored in image files, LinuxLoops are full Linux distros with complete access to your hardware so don't do anything that you would not do in a standard Linux install. Moreover, the LinuxLoops init script has a few dependencies on Linux distros fundamentals (notably the kernel/initramfs naming convention and the presence of a few packages such as bash, cryptsetup and udev), a significant change on those basics should be very rare but might break your install. Even though, if something goes wrong you should always be able to recover your data by mounting the disk image from another LinuxLoops image or from a Linux live usb (see Data-recovery.md), please keep regular backups of your data and keep in mind that this software is provided as is without any guarantee of any kind.**

<!-- Supported Hardware -->
## Supported Hardware

âœ” Base Requirements:
- x86_64 based computer.
- Secure boot disabled.
- Administrative privileges on the device.
- 10 GB available space.
- An entry level understanding of the linux terminal.
  - This guide aims to make this process as easy as possible, but knowing the basics is expected.

## Encryption

The data in LinuxLoops images can be encrypted (rootfs and swap, leaving only the efi and boot partitions unencrypted).

Encryption is highly recommended as it protects physical access to your personal data, however it slightly impacts performance.
  
If you decide to setup encryption, you will receive an encryption password prompt early in the boot process while your keyboard will be in Qwerty, as such:
- Either Learn how to type your password as if your keyboard was Qwerty.
- Or choose a password which is identical when typed on a Qwerty keyboard.

## Support

Support for LinuxLoops is currently provided in the LinuxLoops section of the brunch Discord:

### Pull requests

Clearly in its current state, LinuxLoops is not perfect and I am counting on the community to help by submitting pull requests. However, those needs to respect the ground project principles:
- LinuxLoops partitioning scheme is fixed, it has been defined to limit as much as possible dependencies and to ensure a good performance.
- All distros / desktop environments should offer basic support for all devices (gfx, sound, wifi, bluetooth, ... packages) as long as they are available directly within distro's official repositories.
- Basic desktop environment targets should be debloated (the DE, a terminal and a file browser).
- Full desktops are not based on users preferences but on the choices of the distro managers.
- Lightdm is used by default for basic targets (aside from gnome desktops which often depends on gdm) as it is lightweight and widely compatible.

If you need something else, read about custom scripts or feel free to make your own fork of LinuxLoops.
